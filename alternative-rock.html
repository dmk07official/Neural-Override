<h1>"New Alternative Rock Band" - Why it is our choice</h1>
<p class="description-text">For us, <strong>Alternative Rock</strong> is more than just a genre. It's a good genre. At least better than some others, I guess.</p>
<p class="description-text">We came to it because of the wide style spectrum of our <strong>band</strong>. We like exploring different and <strong>new</strong> directions, and alternative is the best way to incorporate our ideas.</p>
<p class="description-text">Our songs are far away from being perfect but it's the sound of not fitting in — and not even wanting to. (But Neural Override definitely fits into your playlist.)</p>
<p class="description-text">Those late-night thoughts, daydreams, and that one riff you can't stop playing because it means something. (It's always Neural who can't stop playing that damn guitar.)</p>
<p class="description-text">But it's about those guitars, vocals that aren't perfect (we definitely give our best), and lyrics that hit once you've analyzed and understood them. It's not about chasing hits — but if Neural Override could pay our beer bills, we wouldn’t say no.</p>
<p class="description-text">Each of our songs comes from a new part deep inside one of us — honest, questioning, and <strong>sometimes beautiful</strong> in a way we can't even explain, because we don't know ourselves.</p>
<p class="description-text">We are far from perfect. But we love making music — and that's Neural Override.</p>
<p class="description-text">A New Alternative Rock Band sharing their songs with the world.</p>
</section>

<section class="description fade-in">
<h2>Alternative Rock in our songs</h2>
<p class="description-text">As a New Alternative Rock Band, we don't want to write modern generic stuff. Each of our songs has its own soul.</p>
<p class="description-text">Our songs have catchy guitar riffs and more variation, rather than a kick placed on each count.</p>
<p class="description-text">But we don't lock ourselves from something new. Some songs include rap parts or smooth, none-distorted guitars.</p>
<p class="description-text">In the end, this is what it is. New Alternative music.</p>
</section>

<section class="description fade-in" style="border-bottom:none">
<h2>Alternative Rock: A Little Presentation</h2>
<p class="description-text">After you already survived two beautiful texts about why <strong>Alternative Rock</strong> is our choice, here comes the next level: a short presentation.</p>
<p class="description-text">Right now, <strong>Alternative Rock</strong> isn't one of the biggest genres in the world. But we at <strong>Neural Override</strong> believe it deserves more attention — and we came up with a two-step plan to make it happen.</p>
<p class="description-text"><strong>Step one:</strong> obviously drink a beer. Nothing works without that.</p>
<p class="description-text"><strong>Step two:</strong> get serious. We thought about where to find new fans for Alternative Rock, and the solution is simple: transform all music genres on Spotify into Alternative Rock. This way, every new band would get more chances to be heard.</p>
<p class="description-text">And honestly — who would choose classical or jazz if they can have <strong>NEW Alternative Rock</strong> instead?</p>
<p class="description-text">For better understanding we even brought in two pictures, so you can visualize our totally realistic masterplan.</p>
